> ### _Motorball ([Teaser](https://playmotorball.com/))_ 2020
>  Developed alongside _Golf Blitz_, _Motorball_ is using a similar tech stack, with a networked realtime 2D physics simulation and a GameSparks backend. My responsibilities included programming most of the gameplay mechanics, tuning the box2d physics, and much of the menu UI.

> ### _King Chomp ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.elemelee))_ 2017
>   This was a proof-of-concept / stress-test project used to test Noodlecake's internally developed netcode framework in a live setting. It is a free to play four-player realtime multiplayer game.

>### _Super Stickman Golf 3 ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.ssg3)/[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-stickman-golf-3/id1002132680))_ 2016
