## More About Me
### Career Growth
I'm interested in continuing to grow as a programmer and also as a team member. I love getting stuck into hard problems, and I really enjoy learning new technologies when I get the chance. Part of what is great about game development is that the problems are almost always novel in some way. I have been fortunate enough to have attended GDC a few times and always come back re-energized and wanting to try something new.
I want to learn and develop my skills as a technical lead and within management as well. I see developing processes as a fine balance between creativity/agility and stability/productivity -- I think a good process can be beneficial to both, and I want to keep improving on finding that balance.

### Artistry
I hold a 1-year Ontario College Certificate in Art Fundamnetals from [Sheridan College](https://www.sheridancollege.ca/). Ever since childhood I've been a bit of an artist. I enjoy drawing, painting, and sculpture. I try my hand at the odd art/craft whenever I get a chance, and have funneled most of my artistic creativity into my game development career.

### Dogs
I am a dog enthusiast - I have five!
I have gotten pretty interested in the basics of dog training, more out of necessity than anything else; but it is a fun hobby nonetheless. I don't compete in any dog sports, but I do enjoy a bit of training in tricks, rally-o and scent discrimination with my guys. I've also become a bit of a... seamsman? as a result of getting into sewing my own custom martingale collars for all of them.

### Hiking & Camping
There is something about being outdoors that you just can't get any other way. I love the occasional back-country camping trip with a few good friends. I've done a few decent hikes through the Rockies and always love getting out there.

### Boxing & Martial Arts
I've been training as a boxer for the past year and a half and have been loving the challenge. I've also recently taken up Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and found it as a whole new and equally exciting challenge. They help me stay fit and keep me fresh mentally and physically. I love to share this hobby with anyone I can convince to come along to a class!
